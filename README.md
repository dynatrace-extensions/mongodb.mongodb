# MongoDB (Prometheus) 
The MongoDB (Prometheus) uses Prometheus to collect server data remotely and locally.  
Collective batch of data is gathered every minute by the MongoDB data exporter and send through Prometheus to Dynatrace platform for detailed analysis.   

**This is intended for users, who:**
- Would like to monitor database traffic for optimization plan 
- Already use Prometheus and would like to extend its scope of collected data 

**This enables you to:**
- Monitor database operations with a comprehensive dashboard 
- Use Prometheus as the data source 
- Take pre-emptive measures to avoid service degradations 

**Compatibility Requirements**
- Host running MongoDB server and Prometheus ‘Percona’ exporter dedicated for MongoDB monitoring. 

## Install
See [install](Install.md) for details

## Usage
For now go for [dev](#dev)

## Dev

### Prerequisites
- Nix-capable environment, for Windows that means [installing WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux/2-enable-and-install)
- [nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) / [**nix for WSL**](https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-install-windows)
- Docker (available in the same environment as nix, required for running companions)

Hint: if something doesn't work because of missing package please add the package to `default.nix` instead of installing on your computer. Why solve the problem for one if you can solve the problem for all? ;)

### Everything
```
nix-shell
# caution! if this is your first pull of first extension ever this might take some time
# depending on your network connection
# after it completes: inside the shell
make help
```

### Convinience
This section is entirely **optional**. The repository contains additional amenities, but they're not so straightforward, so we don't recommend them for begginers.  Anyway, you might also like:
- [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) (which can be installed easily via `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.direnv`)
